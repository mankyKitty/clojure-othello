# Othello (Clojure Stylez)

This is a Clojure implementation of the incredibly awesome Othello
board game. I plan on making this into a ClojureScript project, as
well as maybe a desktop OpenGL version just as an excuse to play with
OpenGL because...it's OpenGL. 

## Installation

Nothing to install yet though feel free to take a fork full and toy
with the code. I will update this as much as I can.

## Usage

This would probably work after I actually compile it into a Jar. >.>

    $ java -jar othello-0.1.0-standalone.jar [args]

## Options

Initial Options I might put in a conf file of some description.

## Examples

Current output for an 8x8 board, isn't it PRETTY!
```
